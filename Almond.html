           <h1> Almond Milk </h1>
         <p> Almond milk has become the darling of plant based milks. Almond milkis taking over the market and now makes up two thirds of the plant based milk market in the U.S. While a handful of almonds is loaded with nutrition like protein, fiber, antioxidants and healthy fats, to get the equivalent nutrition of a handful of almonds, you would need to drink about 48 ounces of almond milk for the same nutrition and a massive amount of calories.</p>
        
         <p>Almonds themselves require a large amount of water to grow, and almond milk, of course takes even more. So the amount of almonds you actually get in a glass of almond milk is pretty low. In fact, almonds are often actually the third ingredient, depending on the brand of almond milk you are drinking. Cartons of almond milk can contain as low as 2% almonds, the rest water, sugar, added vitamins and minerals, and thickening agents like carrageenan, and guar gum, which can upset stomachs. However, some brands are moving away from the carrageenan and adding an emulsifier-thickener-stabilizer known as gellan gum that seems to be less irritating to the digestive system.</p>
         
         <p> Almond milk is not bad if you just want a little on your cereal or in your coffee now and then, but don’t start guzzling it because you think it is as nutritious as a handful of almonds. Go for the unsweetened version if you can, otherwise, it’s a lot of empty calories with little nutrition.</p>
