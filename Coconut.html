         <h1>Coconut Milk</h1>
         <p>Coconut milk isn’t the same stuff you get straight from the coconut–it is processed a bit more. And don’t confuse the canned coconut milk with the more processed coconut milk in the carton. They are two very different products! Coconut milk has a smooth, creamy flavor, and generally does not have much of a coconut taste. And if you are a first timer with plant-based milks, this may be a good one to try, as it generally has a pretty neutral flavor with no aftertaste like some plant-based milks. </p>
         
         <p>Coconut milk is loaded with medium-chain triglycerides (an easily-digested healthy fat that helps burn fat), potassium, a host of fortified vitamins, and calcium. As with the other plant based milks, avoid the kinds with added sugar, and go for the unsweetened variety. </p>
         
         <p>Coconut milk is A decent milk substitute, but low in protein. </p>
